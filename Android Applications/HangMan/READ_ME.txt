Android application for a simple game of hangman. Word is randomly selected
from a hardcoded dictionary in a JSON file. The word is toasted to the screen 
for testing purposes. The user must sign in with a google account in order
to play. The user must guess a letter of the word, the user is allowed 3 wrong
answers. The user can guess the word. If word is guessed correctly a toast
saying "you win" will show up if guessed wrong the user loses. The user also
loses if 3 wrong answers are entered.
